Adventure Time
==============

The best text adventure engine ever. To be used, just place your own adventure (or use a predefined one) in the `adventures` folder and start the engine:

```
  sbcl --load adventure-time.lisp
```

Once you are into the engine, just start your world:

```
  (start "adventures/test.adventure")
```

Have fun, don't cheat!
